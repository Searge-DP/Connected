Connected
=========
Connected! is a connected textures API for Minecraft 1.7.10 that allows your blocks to have connected textures in multiple forms.  
The ones that are implemented right now are:
- Normal blocks
- FMP microblocks
- BuildCraft facades
- EnderIO painted blocks
- EnderIO conduit facades
- Blocks implementing CoFHLib's *IBlockAppearance* interface
  
Other mod blocks I'm going to try to add support for are:
- AE2 Facades (I'm currently working on a PR to get it working)
- Carpenter's Blocks

Usage in mods as an API
=========
DO NOT USE IT FOR NOW.
